# Clinical Practice Guidelines — Internal Medicine

## Hypertension Management

Blood pressure targets: systolic below 130 mmHg and diastolic below 80 mmHg for most adults. First-line antihypertensive agents include ACE inhibitors (e.g. lisinopril, enalapril), ARBs (e.g. losartan, valsartan), thiazide diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone), and calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine). Combination therapy is recommended when blood pressure is more than 20/10 mmHg above goal. Lifestyle modifications — weight reduction, DASH diet, sodium restriction below 2.3 g/day, aerobic exercise 150 min/week, and alcohol moderation — should accompany pharmacological treatment. Monitor renal function and electrolytes within 2–4 weeks of starting ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Resistant hypertension: consider mineralocorticoid antagonist (spironolactone) and referral to nephrology or cardiology.

## Heart Failure Management

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤ 40%): cornerstone therapy includes ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta-blockers (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone). SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) are now recommended to reduce hospitalisations and cardiovascular mortality. Loop diuretics (furosemide) for congestion relief. Target resting heart rate below 70 bpm. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥ 50%): control blood pressure and heart rate, treat underlying causes (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes), SGLT2 inhibitors show mortality benefit. Monitor daily weight; instruct patient to seek care if weight increases more than 2 kg in 48 hours.

## Atrial Fibrillation Management

Rate control: beta-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) for non-urgent rate reduction; target resting heart rate below 110 bpm in stable patients. Rhythm control: consider in symptomatic patients under 65 years with paroxysmal AF. Cardioversion (electrical or pharmacological with flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone). Anticoagulation: calculate CHA₂DS₂-VASc score; score ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women warrants anticoagulation. Prefer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs: apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) over vitamin K antagonists. Assess bleeding risk with HAS-BLED score. Ablation (pulmonary vein isolation) indicated for symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs.

## Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Management

HbA1c target: below 7.0% for most patients; below 8.0% for elderly or those with frequent hypoglycaemia. First-line: metformin (if tolerated and eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min). Add-on agents based on comorbidities: SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin) preferred in cardiovascular disease or heart failure; GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide) preferred in obesity or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Insulin therapy when HbA1c remains uncontrolled or in acute illness. Monitor eGFR and albuminuria annually. ACE inhibitor or ARB for diabetic nephropathy (eGFR 30–60 and/or albuminuria). Foot examination at every visit; annual ophthalmology referral for retinopathy screening.

## COPD Management

COPD severity: use GOLD classification (A, B, E) based on symptoms (mMRC or CAT score) and exacerbation history. Bronchodilators: short-acting beta-agonists (SABA: salbutamol) and short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA: ipratropium) for rescue. Maintenance: long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA: tiotropium, umeclidinium) as first-line for most patients. Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA: salmeterol, formoterol, indacaterol) for additional bronchodilation. Triple therapy (LABA + LAMA + ICS) for high-risk patients with frequent exacerbations or blood eosinophils above 300 cells/μL. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS): add in exacerbation-prone patients; reassess annually. Pulmonary rehabilitation for all symptomatic patients. Supplemental oxygen if resting SpO₂ ≤ 88% or PaO₂ ≤ 55 mmHg. Smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention.

## Pneumonia Management

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): assess severity with CURB-65 (confusion, urea >7 mmol/L, respiratory rate ≥30, BP <90/60, age ≥65). Score 0–1: outpatient treatment with amoxicillin 500 mg–1 g TID or doxycycline 100 mg BID for 5 days. Score 2: consider hospitalisation; amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefuroxime with macrolide (azithromycin). Score ≥ 3: hospitalise; beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin). Atypical coverage (Mycoplasma, Legionella, Chlamydia): macrolide or fluoroquinolone. Duration: 5–7 days for uncomplicated CAP. Blood cultures before antibiotics in severe CAP or immunosuppressed patients. Urinary antigen test for Legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

## Acute Kidney Injury Management

Identify and correct reversible causes: hypovolaemia, nephrotoxic agents (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, contrast), urinary obstruction, sepsis. Fluid resuscitation: isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or lactated Ringer) for hypovolaemic AKI; target mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg. Stop nephrotoxic medications. Avoid or reduce contrast-enhanced imaging when possible. Monitor urine output hourly in ICU; target >0.5 mL/kg/h. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) indications: severe hyperkalaemia (K⁺ >6.5 mEq/L refractory to treatment), metabolic acidosis (pH <7.15), volume overload unresponsive to diuretics, uremic complications (encephalopathy, pericarditis). Nutritional support: avoid protein restriction; target 1.2–2 g/kg/day in critically ill patients. Follow-up with nephrology within 3 months after AKI episode.

## Antibiotic Stewardship Principles

Prescribe antibiotics only when bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected. Obtain cultures before initiating therapy whenever feasible. De-escalate therapy based on culture and sensitivity results (narrow-spectrum agents preferred). Duration: use the shortest effective course; reassess at 48–72 hours. Intravenous-to-oral switch: transition to oral antibiotics when patient is haemodynamically stable, afebrile for 24 hours, and tolerating oral intake. Document indication, drug, dose, and planned duration in the medical record. Review allergy history: penicillin allergy — perform risk stratification; most patients with self-reported penicillin allergy can receive cephalosporins safely.

## Venous Thromboembolism Management

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): assess severity with Wells score and PERC rule. Anticoagulation: DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban) preferred for most patients with DVT/PE without cancer; enoxaparin bridging to warfarin or LMWH monotherapy for cancer-associated thrombosis or high bleeding risk. Duration: provoked DVT/PE — 3 months; unprovoked DVT/PE — minimum 3 months, consider extended therapy. Massive PE with haemodynamic instability: systemic thrombolysis (alteplase) or catheter-directed therapy. DVT prophylaxis: enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily or unfractionated heparin 5000 units TID for hospitalised medical patients with limited mobility; add mechanical prophylaxis (compression stockings or pneumatic compression) for high-risk surgical patients.

## Sepsis Management (Surviving Sepsis Campaign)

Hour-1 bundle: measure lactate; obtain blood cultures (at least 2 sets) before antibiotics; administer broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition; start IV crystalloid resuscitation (30 mL/kg) for hypotension or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L; apply vasopressors if MAP below 65 mmHg during or after resuscitation. Vasopressors: norepinephrine first-line; add vasopressin 0.03 units/min if norepinephrine dose escalating; consider hydrocortisone 200 mg/day IV for septic shock unresponsive to fluids and vasopressors. Source control: identify and control infection source within 6–12 hours. De-escalate antibiotics at 48–72 hours based on cultures. Target glucose 140–180 mg/dL with insulin infusion. Lung-protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg IBW, plateau pressure ≤30 cmH₂O) for ARDS. Reassess fluid balance daily; avoid fluid overload.

## Stroke Management

Ischaemic stroke: activate stroke protocol immediately. CT head to exclude haemorrhage. IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset if no contraindications. Mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion (LVO) up to 24 hours in selected patients. Blood pressure management: do not treat hypertension unless BP >220/120 or thrombolysis planned (target <185/110 before, <180/105 after). Antiplatelet therapy: dual antiplatelet (aspirin + clopidogrel) for 21 days in minor stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD₂ score ≥4). Anticoagulation for cardioembolic stroke (AF): initiate within 2–14 days depending on infarct size. Haemorrhagic stroke: reverse anticoagulation, control BP (target systolic 140–160), neurosurgical consultation for cerebellar or large haematoma.

## Palliative Care and End-of-Life Principles

Introduce goals-of-care conversations early for patients with life-limiting illness. Document advance directives and code status. Pain management: use WHO analgesic ladder; morphine is the gold standard for severe pain; titrate to effect; anticipate opioid side effects (constipation — prescribe prophylactic laxatives; nausea — metoclopramide). Dyspnoea: low-dose morphine and oxygen as needed; anxiolytics (lorazepam) for refractory dyspnoea or terminal agitation. Artificial nutrition and hydration: discuss risks and benefits; not recommended routinely in actively dying patients. Refer to palliative care team for complex symptom management or family support needs.
